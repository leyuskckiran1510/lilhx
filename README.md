Lilhx is a to-be frontend framework that introduces a reactive state management system along with features reminiscent of htmx. This framework empowers developers to build dynamic and responsive web applications effortlessly. Here's an elaborate exploration of some key features:

## Features:

### Reactive States:
Lilhx incorporates a reactive state management system, enabling developers to effortlessly handle and manipulate the state of their web applications. This reactive approach ensures that changes in state trigger automatic updates, providing a seamless and efficient user experience.

### Event Handling:
#### i. Click Events:
   - **Verbs:**
     1. **Fetch:**
        - Attribute: `fetch="url"`
        - Method: `"get"` (default) or any HTTP method
        - **Actions:**
            - `swap_inner`: Replace inner content
            - `swap_outer`: Replace the entire element
            - `append`: Append content
            - `prepend`: Prepend content
            - `n_swap`: Replace the nth child element (`n_swap=1` for the first child, `n_swap=n` for the nth child)
            - `callback`: Execute a custom function (`function_name`) on successful fetch response. The function receives three parameters: `element`, `target`, and `fetch_response`. The `fetch_response` is expected to be a text containing HTML/markup for the next state or the body of an element.

     2. **Stateful Actions:**
        - *Save State:* Use `save_state` attribute to persist the current state in the body.
        - *Load State:* Use `load_state` attribute to load a previously saved session state.

#### ii. Other Working Features:
   - *Ongoing Development:* Lilhx is a work in progress and aims to provide a synergy of features from htmx and React. Stay tuned for more exciting updates and enhancements.

Lilhx is designed to streamline the development process, offering a harmonious blend of reactivity and powerful event handling. It caters to the needs of developers who seek a modern and efficient framework for crafting dynamic web applications.
